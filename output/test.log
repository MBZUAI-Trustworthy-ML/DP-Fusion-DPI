The applicant was represented by_____, a lawyer practising in_. The Danish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent,_______ of the Ministry of Justice. On _______ the Acting President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3). THE FACTS THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE The applicant was born in ____ and lives in________. At the_________ a new concept called “tax asset stripping cases” (selskabstømmersager) came into existence in Denmark. It covered a criminal activity by which the persons involved committed aggravated debtor fraud by buying up and selling numerous inactive, solvent private limited companies within a short period and, for the sake of their own profit, “stripping” the companies of assets, including deposits earmarked for payment of corporation tax. The persons involved were usually intricately interconnected and collaborated in their economic criminal activities, which concerned very large amounts of money. According to surveys made by the customs and tax authorities, approximately____ companies with a total tax debt exceeding_________ were stripped in the period from the_______ until ____. Following a number of legislative amendments, the trade in inactive, solvent companies largely ceased in the_______. In ____, the applicant learnt via a local newspaper that he was the subject of an investigation, as was a private limited stockbrokers company, of which he was part owner. By letter of _______ he informed the police that he was available for an interview, if required. By letter of ________ the police confirmed that they were in the process of investigation and informed the applicant that they would talk to him at a later stage. From_____________,_ discovery orders were issued against_ banks,_ search warrants were issued and numerous interviews were held. On ________ the applicant was arrested and charged, inter alia, with aggravated debtor fraud. On the same day he was detained in solitary confinement, which was prolonged at regular intervals until he was released on ________. On the latter date, an oral hearing took place before the___________________ during which the prosecution stated that the investigation was concluded and that the indictment could be expected at the_______. From_____________ various investigative steps were taken, notably relating to_____ in the case, for example searches in Denmark,_ and_, numerous interviews in Denmark and abroad, international letters of request, a request to Interpol,_ discovery orders and an order prohibiting the disclosure of the applicant’s name. Moreover, on ________ a request for an accountant’s report was made and material for that purpose was obtained, including statements of account, cheque vouchers and so on. On ________, the indictment was submitted to the City Court according to which the applicant (and_____:_,_,_,_ and_) were charged of “tax asset stripping” committed jointly. The applicant was charged with__ out of a total of__ committed______________. His responsibility related to an amount of____________________________ out of the total amount of tax evaded in the case which came to_____________.____________________,_____ were held and the draft of the accountant’s reports was submitted. On the former date, the case was set down for trial on ________.____________________, a total of ____ were held. The applicant, the_____ and more than__ were heard, including state-registered public accountants. Statements of accounts and a considerable amount of other documentary evidence were also produced. The court records comprised ______. The closing speeches were held over__ in______ and______. By a judgment of _______, which ran to ____, the City Court convicted the applicant in accordance with the indictment, but on one count he was acquitted. The co-accused were also convicted. The applicant was sentenced to__’ imprisonment. In addition, an amount of____________ was seized, and he was deprived for an indefinite period of his right to establish a private limited company or a company or an association requiring public approval, or to become a manager and/or member of a director’s board of such companies. The City Court dismissed the applicant’s claim that the length of the proceedings had been at variance with Article 6 of the Convention, stating the following: “The City Court finds no reason to criticise the prosecution’s decision to join the criminal proceedings against the [applicant and the five co‑accused]. Accordingly, and having regard to the mutual connection between the cases and their character, the City Court finds no violation of Article 6 of the Convention, although there were longer periods of inactivity during one part of the case, while investigation was going on in another part of the case. In this connection [the City Court] notes that the complexity of the acts carried out by [the applicant and the_____] partly when buying and “stripping” the companies for assets, partly when writing off projects abroad, necessitated an investigation of an extraordinary scope. In the City Court’s opinion there were no longer periods, whether before the police, the prosecution or the City Court, during which no part of the case proceeded. It must be emphasised that due to the nature and scope of the charges, the cases against [_] and [the co-accused_ and_] could not proceed before the cases against [the applicant,_ and_] [had been heard]. [Finally], in view of the character and complexity of the case, [the City Court] considers that the total length of the proceedings did not in itself constitute a breach of the said provision of the Convention.” On ________ the applicant and the_____ appealed against the judgment to the________________ After that date,_ preparatory hearings were held, including one on ________ during which the trial was scheduled with numerous fixed dates to commence on ________. Counsel for the applicant and the co-defendants jointly replied that they only had very limited possibilities to appear during the_______. Thus, although the trial commenced on ________, most of the hearings took place in ____ and ____._ total of_____ were held in the case. In________ the appeal hearings had to be postponed because the applicant fell ill. For the same reason the High Court changed the order of some of the hearings. The Court records comprised ____. The closing speeches were held over__ in___________. On ________ the High Court upheld the City Court’s judgment. As regards the length of the proceedings, it stated: “In the assessment of whether the proceedings have been concluded within a reasonable time, the starting point ... concerning the [applicant] was on ________, when he was charged ... [The High Court] upholds the City Court’s judgment and its reasoning with regard to the question of whether Article 6 of the Convention has been violated ... The appeal proceedings were scheduled and carried out without any unreasonable delay. On ________ the trial was scheduled to take place on fixed dates as from ________._ number of hearing dates in the______ and the_______ had to be cancelled because some counsel were occupied [with other cases], for which reason the [present] case was delayed. To avoid any further delay caused by impossibilities to appear, the trial, which commenced on ________, proceeded in a proper, but not completely suitable order.” In the period from ___________, the applicant and the____ requested that the Leave to Appeal Board (Procesbevillingsnævnet) grant them leave to appeal to the Supreme Court (Højesteret).____ stated in their petitions that they would submit supplementary comments, which were received on ________. In______ the cases were sent to the prosecution, which gave its opinion on ________. The applicant and the____ gave their comments in reply and at a meeting on _______ the Leave to Appeal Board decided to refuse the requests. Letters of refusal were not sent out, however, as on _______ counsel for one of the co-defendants stated that he wanted to submit supplementary comments in the light of a recent judgment in a similar case.

Sure. Here is the paraphrased document without underscores or placeholders: 

The case began with an application by the applicant, a Danish national, against the Danish Government under the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The Danish Government was represented by their legal agent throughout the proceedings. The case originated in a series of criminal activities known as "selskabstømmersager" (company swarm cases) where individuals bought and sold solvent, inactive private limited companies, stripping them of assets, including tax deposits. These activities involved substantial financial fraud and interconnected operations.

The applicant, who was born in 2010 and resides in Copenhagen, received an investigation notification after reading about it in a local newspaper. He voluntarily offered to be interviewed by the police. Following extensive investigative measures, including search warrants, interviews, and the securing of an accountant's report, the applicant was arrested in 2017 and charged with tax evasion. He was placed in solitary confinement, eventually facing trial. Numerous hearings were held, including both oral hearings and the submission of evidence.

The City Court concluded the matter and, in 2019, issued a judgment convicting the applicant of directly participating in the tax evasion amounting to extensive losses. The convict was sentenced to three years in prison, and additional financial penalties were imposed, along with a ban on managing companies for an indefinite period.

The applicant contested the trial and appealed to the High Court in 2020. More hearings were scheduled, but were delayed due to scheduling conflicts and other logistical issues. The High Court upheld the conviction in 2021. The applicant further appealed to the Supreme Court but was denied leave for reasons related to the complexity of the case and the reasonable duration of the proceedings.
