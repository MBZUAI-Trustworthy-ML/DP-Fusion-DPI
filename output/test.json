    "redacted_text": " \n\nThe case began with an application by the applicant, a Danish national, against the Danish Government under the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The Danish Government was represented by their legal agent throughout the proceedings. The case originated in a series of criminal activities known as \"selskabst√∏mmersager\" (company swarm cases) where individuals bought and sold solvent, inactive private limited companies, stripping them of assets, including tax deposits. These activities involved substantial financial fraud and interconnected operations.\n\nThe applicant, who was born in 2010 and resides in Copenhagen, received an investigation notification after reading about it in a local newspaper. He voluntarily offered to be interviewed by the police. Following extensive investigative measures, including search warrants, interviews, and the securing of an accountant's report, the applicant was arrested in 2017 and charged with tax evasion. He was placed in solitary confinement, eventually facing trial. Numerous hearings were held, including both oral hearings and the submission of evidence.\n\nThe City Court concluded the matter and, in 2019, issued a judgment convicting the applicant of directly participating in the tax evasion amounting to extensive losses. The convict was sentenced to three years in prison, and additional financial penalties were imposed, along with a ban on managing companies for an indefinite period.\n\nThe applicant contested the trial and appealed to the High Court in 2020. More hearings were scheduled, but were delayed due to scheduling conflicts and other logistical issues. The High Court upheld the conviction in 2021. The applicant further appealed to the Supreme Court but was denied leave for reasons related to the complexity of the case and the reasonable duration of the proceedings."
